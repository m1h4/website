My name is Marko Mihovilić and I’m a 30-year-old software engineer living and working in [Zagreb](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zagreb), Croatia (some of you might be looking
at the map and thinking “where in the hell is this”, but believe me, its much nicer here than hell, just give it a chance :)).

As my [twitter](https://twitter.com/m1h0v1l1c) profile nicely puts it: *“Web and mobile developer by day, wannabe game/graphics developer by night. Loves tinkering with
things to find out how they work.”* – this would be the most up-to-date short summary of my persona.
