Here are some of my applications I’ve found the time to clean-up and package decently enough to feel comfortable about releasing to the public :)

## [Analyzed]({{< relref "apps/analyzed.md" >}})

One of the first applications I’ve ever released publicly: a cool minimalistic visualization plugin for **Windows Media Player**.

## [Audio Analyzer]({{< relref "apps/audio-analyzer.md" >}})

Audio visualization application that was a kind of personal research project into computer graphics and audio processing while studying for my college degree.

## [Kurve]({{< relref "apps/kurve.md" >}})

Fun multiplayer game I made to play with my friends, inspired by **Achtung, die Kurve**.
