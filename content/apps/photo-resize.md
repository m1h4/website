**Photo Resize** is a simple sharing extension for **Android** which helps you send photos via email or
messaging more quickly. It creates a temporary smaller version of your photo before you send it so
that you don’t have to send the full couple of megabytes of a 8MP photo via email.

You can find and follow **Photo Resize** on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/110566457682763103664).
