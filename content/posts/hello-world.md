I’ve finally taken the time to arrange a dedicated web server and created a more professional and comprehensive website.
There will still be some ongoing effort to improve the design and content so do not perceive this as complete yet.
If you find something missing/not quite right or otherwise have any useful suggestions, please give me a call (oh, and
that’s in the Internet sense of things, actually calling me on the phone would be really weird :)).
